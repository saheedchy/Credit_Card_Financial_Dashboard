### 1.Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze credit card transaction performance. It provides insights into total revenue, transaction volume and interest earned across different quarters, card types, income groups, and customer segments. The dashboard helps identify key revenue drivers by education level, job type, and spending categories, enabling data-driven decision-making for business growth.

### 2.Core Tools

• Power BI Desktop: The main application used for data modeling, report creation, and visualization development.
• SQL (Structured Query Language): Serves as the database technology for data storage, initial processing, and cleaning of credit card transaction and customer data.
• Power Query (M Language): Used within Power BI Desktop to connect to the SQL database, import and extract data, and perform essential cleaning and transformation tasks before modeling.

### 3. Data Modeling & Calculation:

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): The formula language used to create calculated measures and columns for advanced financial analysis. This is critical for generating KPIs like:
• Time-based totals (daily, weekly, monthly transaction volume). <br>
• Financial performance indicators (e.g., payment defaults, profitability metrics). <br>
• Data Modeling: The process of defining relationships between various tables (like transactions and customer demographics) to ensure accurate analysis and reporting.

### 4. Visualization & Interactivity
   
The dashboard leverages several types of visuals to communicate financial and customer insights effectively:

• Card Visuals / KPIs: Used to display high-level, critical metrics (Key Performance Indicators) such as total transaction amount, total transaction cocunt and total revenue at a glance. <br>
• Line Charts: Used to visualize trends revenue, such as revenue and total transaction count by qtr. <br>
• Bar Charts / Column Charts: Employed for comparisons, such as transaction volume by type, demographic distributions (age/gender), or revenue breakdown across categories. <br>
• Pie Charts / Donut Charts: Show the distribution of data, such as the breakdown of transaction types (purchases vs. cash advances) or the distribution of credit limits. <br>
• Slicers and Filters: Enable users to interactively explore the data based on specific criteria, such as date range, customer segment, or credit limit distribution. <br>
• Conditional Formatting: Can be used to highlight anomalies or potential fraud by visually identifying unusual spikes or drops in transaction data.

### Business Problem:

The core business problem this Credit Card Dashboard addresses is the need for financial institutions or credit card providers to gain actionable clarity into their credit card operations, financial health, and customer risk.

### Key questions such as:
• What is the current total revenue and transaction volume (Total Sales/Transaction Amount)?
• How does current performance compare to previous periods? (e.g., Year-over-Year (YOY) or Month-over-Month growth in transactions and revenue).
• What is the revenue distribution across different segments or transaction types?
• Are there any anomalies or unusual spikes in transaction volume or amount that could indicate potential fraud or operational issues?

### Goal of the Dashboard:
The core goal of the Credit Card Dashboard is to provide financial institutions and stakeholders with an integrated, real-time platform for effective monitoring, analysis, and strategic decision-making regarding their credit card operations and customer portfolio.

### Business Impact & Insights:

• The dashboard enables analysis of various card types to see their contribution to revenue and interest earned. It identifies portfolio growth drivers and helps monitor metrics like interchange fees to maximize the value of every transaction.

• It is used to identify and track potential fraud or suspicious activity, such as high-volume transactions or spending outside a customer's norm, thereby avoiding liability and reducing fraud-related losses. It also aids in loss forecasting and monitoring for early warning signs of default or delinquency.

• Analysts can quickly find and extract transaction data to simplify reporting and model creation, saving time. It helps streamline operations by analyzing key metrics like transaction success rates and approval rates versus peers.

• By providing a 360-degree view of the customer, the dashboard helps acquire new customers and increase engagement with existing cardholders. This leads to reduced churn and improved loyalty through hyper-personalized offers.
